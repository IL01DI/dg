Words are divided into six Parts of Speech: Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions.

# Nouns

> [!cite] Definition
> A Noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea.

Since Lingua Latina is an inflected oriented language, all nouns are declined by gender, case, and number.

## Declension

> [!cite] Definition
> Declension is produced by adding terminations originally significant to different forms of stems, vowel, or consonant.

### Gender

Gender can be either natural or grammatical.

A Natural Gender corresponds to the vital sex of the object, while a Grammatical Gender does not correspond to any sex of the object.

Therefore, two of them are feminine and masculine. However, unlike any other languages, Lingua Latina has five in total that represents its respective vocal.

| feminine | masculine | ambiguous | neuter | indefinite | 
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:------:|:----------:|
|   -a-    |    -o-    |    -u-    |  -e-   |    -i-     |

The fact that Lingua Latina has five genders is because the combination between feminine and masculine results in three other genders more.

In which case, the ambiguous gender is in fact both feminine and masculine, or either feminine or masculine; the neuter gender is, nonetheless, neither feminine nor masculine; and the indefinite gender, however, can be either feminine, masculine, or both of them, or none of them.

Because of that, articles and adjectives can override the gender in some nouns that corresponds to either ambiguous or indefinite.

### Case

Case denotes the grammatical roles of nouns within sentences. Each case has a specific function and is marked by distinct suffixes, which helps clarify the relationships between different parts of a sentence.


| Case           | Function                            | 1st Marker | 2nd Marker | Example                       | Gloss                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Nominative** | Subject of the sentence             | -s- / -x-  | -r-        | _los rexos_                   | the king               |
| **Accusative** | Direct object of the verb           | -m-        | -rem-      | _los rexos miran lom arborem_ | the king sees the tree |
| **Dative**     | Indirect object of the verb         | -n-        | -ri-       | _los rexos eion_              | the king to him        |
| **Genitive**   | Possession, relation, or derivation | -t-        | -rit-      | _los rexos arboret_           | the king's tree        |
| **Possessive** | Possession                          | -f-        | -rif-      |                               |                        |
| **Partitive**  | Relation                            | -p-        | -rip-      |                               |                        |
| **Derivative** | Derivation                          | -d-        | -rid-      |                               |                        |

### Number

| singular | dual | plural |
|:--------:|:----:|:------:|
|    -     | -ez  |  -es   |

Moreover, like Latin, Lingua Latina classifies nouns and adjectives differently. Hence, all adjectives are nouns, but not all nouns are adjectives. Some of them are, in fact, called substantives.

To clarify the above declension, all nouns, whether substantive or adjective, are commonly declined.

## Substantive

Etymologically means “stand under”.

As the philosophy also adheres to, such as Aristotle and René Descartes state, a substance is independent by itself.

This is a crucial statement to differ from adjectives, as substantives are always the head of its own noun phrase.

## Adjective

Etymologically means “to attach”.

Its definition clearly marks the adjective to be attached with the substantive. Therefore, it depends on the substantive gender, case, and number. Thus, the adjective gender can be inflected, unlike  substantive.

However, it is grammatically possible that adjectives can be the head of its own noun phrase only if they are not attached to any noun substantive.

### Comparison of adjectives

Lingua Latina, as in English and in Latin, there are three degrees of comparison: the Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative.

# Pronouns

Etymologically means “instead of the name”, pronoun replaces noun without altering its meaning.

They aren't necessary, but they are very practical in usage. Since they are separated from nouns, they have their own declension, however irregular.

A pronoun can be classified between personal, reflexive, possessive, demonstrative, relative, indefinite, and articles.

## Personal pronouns

| person | singular | dual | plural |
|:------:|:--------:|:----:| ------ |
|  1st   |   ego    | noz  | nos    |
|  2nd   |    tu    | voz  | vos    |
|  3rd   |    ei    | eiz  | eis    | 

### Clusivity

| number | non-clusive | inclusive | exclusive |
|:------:|:-----------:|:---------:| --------- |
|  dual  |     noz     |   tunoz   | einoz     |
| plural |     nos     |   tunos   | einos     | 

### 3rd person gender

|   gender   | singular | dual | plural |
|:----------:|:--------:| ---- | ------ |
| masculine  |   eio    | eioz | eios   |
|  feminine  |   eia    | eiaz | eias   |
| ambiguous  |   eiu    | eiuz | eius   |
|   neuter   |   eie    | eiez | eies   |
| indefinite |    ei    | eiz  | eis    |

## Reflexive pronouns



# Verbs

Verbs can express by either a conjugation or a verbal tense.

## Conjugation

Since Lingua Latina is an inflected oriented language, all verbs are conjugated by expressing the tense, aspect, mood, person, and number.

## Verbal Tense

Like English, Lingua Latina provides a periphrastic version.

# Adverbs

## Adverbs of Place
